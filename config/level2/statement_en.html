                Two players face off in a circular map. <br>
                Each player controls <const>2</const> cars. Cars are used to pick-up prisoners, and put them in solitary confinement.
                <br>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align:center"><strong>The Map</strong></p>
                The playing field is a Prison yard, represented with a circle of radius
                <var>mapRadius</var> units. The coordinates
                <const>X=0, Y=0</const> represent the point at <strong>the center</strong>.
                <br>
                A manhole is located in the center of the field. It is circular, with a radius of <var>centerRadius</var> units.
                <br> &nbsp;
                <p style="text-align:center"><strong>The Prisoners </strong></p>
                Prisoners are located in escape pods with a radius of
                <const>100</const> units.
                <br> At the start of a game, Prisoners are placed <strong>randomly</strong> across the map.
                <br> A game always starts with <const>2</const> Prisoners.
                <br> Players must capture them to score points!
                <br> Prisoners roll on the playing field and are not subject to friction.
                <br>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align:center"><strong>The Cars</strong></p>
                A Car is a disc of radius 
                <const>400</const> units. 
                <br> <strong>Cars generate a magnetic field, which allows them to grab the prisoners' escape pods when they are separated by a distance lower than the Car's radius.</strong>
                <br> Cars glide on the playing field and are subject to friction.
                <br>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align:center"><strong>Game mechanics</strong></p>
                <strong>To score one point</strong>, a Player must drop a prisoner into the man hole.
                <br> A new Prisoner will appear on the edge of the prison yard. <const>2</const> Prisoners are always around trying to escape.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>To move a car</strong>, you must print the <strong>X Y coordinates of a target destination</strong> and a <strong>thrust</strong> between
                <const>0</const> and
                <const>200</const>. <br>
                The Car will pivot towards the destination, by a maximum of <const>18</const> degrees. <br>
                It will then apply thrust in that direction. Careful, the faster a Car goes, the harder it is to control!
                <br>
                <br> It is impossible to leave the prison yard. Cars and Prisoners will bounce off the electric fence on the edge of the yard. <strong>Beware, Cars will rebound with surprising momentum!</strong>
                <br> Collisions occur between the pairs: Car-Car, Car-Fence, Prisoner-Fence.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>If the center of a Prisoner enters the radius of a Car, the Prisoner is magnetically attached to the Car.</strong>
                <br>
                <br>The Car's magnetic field is not sufficient to keep hold of a Prisoner during strong collisions. <strong>If two Cars collide with an impulse stronger than <var>minSwapImpulse</var> units, the eventual control of a Prisoner is transferred from one Car to the other.</strong>


                <br> The game ends after
                <const>250</const> turns or as soon as one player has captured <const>10</const> prisoners.
                <br> If a player does not provide output in time or provides incorrect output, they are eliminated and the game ends immediately. If both players are eliminated on the same turn, they will be tied regardless of their score.</div>

                </p>
                <li>To grab a Prisoner, the distance between the center of the Car and the center of the Prisoner must be less than or equal to the <strong>Car's radius - 1</strong>.</li>
                <li>To score one point, the Car must have grabbed a Prisoner and the distance between the man hole and the Car's center point must be less than or equal to the <strong>Man hole's radius - 1</strong>. A new Prisoner will be spawned <const>4000</const> units away from the man hole.</li>
                <li>Collisions are (nearly) elastic. A minimal impulse of
                    <const>120</const> is applied for Car-Car collisions, <const>600</const> for Car-Fence collisions and <const>42</const> for Prisoner-Fence collisions</li>
                <li>Cars have a mass of <const>1</const> unit.
                </li>
            </ul>

            Each turn, the movement of entities is computed as follows:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Thrust</strong>: the Car pivots towards its <strong>destination</strong>, by a maximum of <const>18</const> degrees. The Car's normalized heading vector is multiplied by the thrust power divided by the mass. The result is added to the current speed vector.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Movement</strong>: Their speed vector is added to the position of all entities to compute their new positions. If a collision occurs during the movement, the entities will rebound off one another.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Friction</strong>: the speed vector is multiplied by a constant, then truncated. The constant is:
                    <br>
                    <const>0.85</const> for Cars,
                    <br>
                    <const>1.0</const> for Prisoners
                </li>
                <li>The position values are truncated.</li>
                <li>The cars' heading angle is expressed in degrees and rounded.</li>
            </ol>
            Angle are provided in degrees, and relative to the x axis.
